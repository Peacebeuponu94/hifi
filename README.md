# Hifi Protocol [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/hifi-finance/hifi-protocol/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/hifi-finance/hifi-protocol?branch=main) [![Commitizen Friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) [![License: LGPL3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-LGPL3.0-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0)

An implementation of zero-coupon bonds on the Ethereum blockchain. In-depth documentation on Hifi is available at [docs.hifi.finance](https://docs.hifi.finance).

The built contract artifacts can be browsed via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/browse/@hifi/v1@latest/).

## Developers

Our contracts are written in Solidity and our tests in TypeScript.

If you want to contribute, familiarity with [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat), [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js),
[Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle) and [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain) is needed.
